# bypassWall

Extension to add a "." after the domain name of a customizable set of websites. This will remove paywalls on the NYT, and is reputed to do the same on other news websites. This is, of course extremely hacky, and is not guaranteed to work, or to continue to work.
 
Click on extension to add to or remove a website from the list of URLs to apply the "." to.
